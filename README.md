this is an md file. md file extension (also written as . markdown) stands for 'Markdown documentation'. Markdown is a lightweight mark-up language, and each MD file is written in a particular 'flavour' of Markdown. It can be helpful to think of the different flavours as being like different dialects of one language.

I will also change the README file to see how merging works then.
